        title: "Reflections",
        content: `I would say I try to guide my life by big principles, such as: Mastering my emotions. Accepting what I cannot change. Even more: accepting both happiness and misfortune. Some people say to me, "Muh, you say you want to master your emotions, but look, you're angry/sad/happy." These people obviously haven't understood at all; mastering your emotions doesn't mean rejecting or repressing them, it means accepting and managing them as best as possible with reason—when possible—while knowing there's not really a clear separation between reason and emotion, there are "lateral areas" that are interdependent.

On a larger scale, I'm aware there may be something at play in the idea of materiality and the very concept of existence (I've always had this kind of intuition, even as a child and teenager); that's why I experiment in very different fields: the way of the body, for example, because I'm still a bit into sports, and the way of the mind. I'm clearly missing an artistic path, maybe painting, drawing... Maybe in this sense I'm seeking "the solar way," but at the same time, I'm terribly NORMAL, I'm chained to my daily constraints, eating, working, cleaning, paying my bills, etc.

Soon (let's say in the next 2/3 years), I'd like to experiment with the idea of reproduction, which will no doubt chain me even more to the shackles of materiality and to the most banal thing, but which is also considered the most beautiful. On the other hand, I no longer believe in political action at all, it even makes me laugh—it's not that I don't have ideas in that area, but I don't believe in political action as a way to shape existence. Things can happen, or not, there's certainly an active part involved but also a part of an autonomous process linked to societal factors that may have their roots in psychology or the "spiritual."

I think we must move toward "supra-individual" perspectives because the masses will not save themselves. Deep down, I realize how much I'm marked by reactionary-declinist thinking.`,

        title: "On Genius",
        content: `Genius is often spoken of as an isolated, almost miraculous phenomenon. But perhaps we should see a plurality of forms. Mozart's genius is not Beethoven's. And this difference is not just a matter of musical style, it's a difference in nature.

Mozart, from childhood, escapes ordinary logic. At three, he identifies a detuned violin during a simple lesson. At five, he plays the harpsichord. At six, he composes. He can't read yet, can't count yet, but he already understands the structure of a fugue. Everything seems to flow from him without tension. There's no visible break between the child and the work. No fracture between intuition and form. It's an immediate, almost elusive genius, as if everything he was had to happen, without obstacle.

Beethoven, on the other hand, is a different story. He doesn't have this clear relationship with the world. His father wants to make him a new Mozart. He pushes him, forces him, shapes him. And yet, something else emerges. Something rougher, more human too.
In his letters, we see a man who doubts, who hopes, who clings awkwardly. The one addressed to the "Immortal Beloved"—never sent—shows a naivety, a disarmed tenderness. There is a fragility there that has nothing to do with the image of the triumphant composer.
And maybe that's his genius: having wrested everything from difficulty, solitude, illness, deafness. Not having been carried by grace, but having drawn everything from himself, to exhaustion.

Mozart is a luminous mystery. Beethoven is an opaque struggle.
One seems to have received. The other seems to have traversed.
But both touch something that goes beyond will, and yet is inscribed in it.

And if I had to give my opinion—not to decide, but to situate myself—I'd say that Mozart's music, as perfect as it is, sometimes leaves me at a distance. There's a kind of obviousness, almost too pure, that borders on abstraction. I recognize the genius, but I don't always find the presence of a being there. Whereas with Beethoven, even in his silences, even in his clumsiness, something speaks to me more directly. His Ode to Joy, his Moonlight Sonata, don't seek to shine. They express an inner strength, a tragic gentleness, a way of existing in the tumult. Maybe that's where genius begins for me: not in what impresses, but in what echoes the most vulnerable part of ourselves.`,

        title: "Virility",
        content: `The virilism we're sold is a totally watered-down and reductive version of virility.
There are many ways to express one's virility besides a taste for contact or bodybuilding.

For example, through the vitality one puts into their art (in music, for example), maybe also in a certain conception of life (the theme of "spiritual virility" is often mentioned), and even the expression of a particular, very atypical sensitivity.
The self-sacrifice an archaeologist puts into their work is a form of virility, the vitality of Beethoven's music is a form of virility, the daily courage of a father is a form of virility, seeking virtue like the Stoics or Buddhists is also a form of virility.

Being a fighter or muscular is not proof of virility in itself, it's just one "way of the body" among others.
Shouldn't it take as much (or more) typically masculine skills in disciplines like mountaineering or climbing?
Likewise, conforming to watered-down virility to attract women is not proof of virility, you're just conforming to what pleases a female brain that's often latched onto "trends" of our time, very childish/regressive, you please a brain that's conformed to a superficial or even psychotic appearance of masculinity (hence the "badboy" attraction, hence the "transference" theme in psychiatry).

In fact, a way of virility would be a way of individual unveiling of being, to discover oneself and be in the world as we truly are (or at least get as close as possible) rather than conforming to watered-down models.

In the end, "virilism" mainly speaks to those who lack virility or are not comfortable with it.
A millionaire isn't interested in how to become a millionaire.`,

        title: "Solitude in the Digital Age",
        content: `We live in a world where notifications replace handshakes, where calls are masked by stories, and where intimacy is measured in views and likes. The irony is, we've never been so "connected" as today, and yet, loneliness has never weighed so heavily. This modern loneliness is no longer that of the desert or the cabin lost in the woods. It's a loneliness at the heart of the crowd, in the constant noise of a world that never stops, but no longer listens.

Virilism, this idea that a man must be strong, impenetrable, carved from rock, has done nothing to lighten this burden. On the contrary, it has hidden it. The modern man, seeking recognition in a system that values image over substance, is often alone with himself. He must be efficient, dominant, but never vulnerable. He must handle silences, breakups, doubts, without ever faltering. He must have answers, all the time, when often, he doesn't even have the right questions.

But can we still talk about loneliness when we're constantly invaded? Social networks, messaging, news feeds—everything is made so you're never really alone... but never really with anyone either. This ghostly presence of others, this illusion of proximity, creates an even more chilling void: that of a dialogue without a gaze, an exchange without flesh.

So we build shells. We pretend to be above it all, to feel nothing. We invent solid and controlled lives. But deep down, many chase after a form of sincere, raw, unfiltered recognition. Someone who would see beyond the screen. Someone who would understand without having to explain everything.

The truth is, in this noise-saturated world, knowing how to stay alone with oneself is perhaps the most virile and radical act left. Not to flee others, but to learn to meet oneself. Without a mask. Without staging. Because in the end, true strength isn't being alone against all. It's being whole, even when the world pushes you to fragment yourself to sell better.`,

        title: "The Sunday Oracles",
        content: `For some time now, a new species has been sprouting like weeds on social networks: the newly-minted know-it-alls, the coaches of a world in crisis, the truth-makers à la Instagram.
They've barely left mental adolescence and are already perched on high chairs, preaching about fulfillment, posture, gratitude, and other neo-mystical incantations for corporate use.

It's not their knowledge that's annoying, no. Everyone learns as they can, that's not the issue. What irritates, what gently grates the nerves, is the tone. That moralizing and caressing tone, that way of looking at you like a slightly slow student who hasn't yet understood life, they who have mastered it in six modules and a LinkedIn certification.

There's a pity in their gaze dressed in light, a condescension veiled in positive intentions. They explain to you, eyelids half-closed, how to manage your emotions, your relationship to work, your childhood traumas, and sometimes even your digestion.

They always use simple words, but never innocent: "set a framework," "be in listening mode," "bring awareness," "reveal your potential." So many empty expressions, foam swords brandished in an arena of soft egos.

But maybe, deep down, they're not the problem. It's the era that made them. An era where doubt is scary, where you have to know and assert to exist. An era that prefers little guides to prefab happiness over great rough texts, where we think we can heal the human soul with mindmaps.

So they play the game. They climb a little higher, not to enlighten, but to exist. They dream of being guides, but only pass the word: "be your best version." And never mind if that version is hollow, as long as it shines a little.

So, what to do? Maybe we should all question this incessant need to reinvent ourselves in a few hours, a few clicks, a few trainings. Because in the end, it's all an illusion, a desperate attempt to turn a stone into a diamond, with coaches who themselves don't have the key to the process.`,

        title: "Welcome, friend, to the urban playground",
        content: `Welcome, friend, to the urban playground,
where everyday life is a carnival of neuroses and incompetence,
and where every street corner tells a new story of modern decline.

Entering downtown, you'll immediately be struck by the intoxicating scent of sweet pollution.
The skies are covered by its fumes, as if even the sun had decided to resign in the face of ambient ineptitude.
People don't look at the sky anyway! No, it's the skyscrapers!
Their facades are covered with graffiti as artistic as a schoolboy's joke.
The tags, as boldly creative as a broken photocopier, adorn every wall, every billboard, every dark corner.

Traffic, watch out, is a real chaotic ballet of angry horns and drivers
who seem to have learned to drive in Roman arenas.
Sidewalks, designed for pedestrians, are invaded by souped-up scooters,
kamikaze cyclists, and an urban fauna that includes as many rats as humans.
Vermin thrives here, between overflowing trash cans and sewers exhaling dystopian fumes.
Don't hang around too late at night, it can be sketchy... But during the day too, actually!

During the day, small-time thugs fight for territory with the same fervor
as a hot dog vendor would defend his spot.
Pickpockets, scammers, and counterfeit sellers mingle with the crowd,
offering every passerby a unique opportunity to get ripped off.
Tourists, recognizable by their lost look and their tendency to photograph
graffiti, museums or whatever – hehe... – are the favorite prey in this urban safari.

At nightfall, downtown turns into a theater of the absurd
worthy of the best film noir.
Dark alleys become arenas where night criminals operate
with the skill of a bad reality TV actor.
Between beggars claiming their sidewalk spot and dealers operating
with the discretion of a police siren, the atmosphere is both tragic and laughable.

Storefronts, protected by metal grilles,
offer a spectacle of flashing neon lights and dubious goods.
Bars and clubs, with their bright and garish signs, attract a clientele as motley as it is desperate.
Night workers, whether waiters, bartenders or just partygoers,
navigate this urban jungle with a resignation tinged with cynicism.

In short, you get it, friend,
this place is a living parody of modernity,
a playground where daily triviality meets grotesque caricature.
It's a world where insecurity and stress are our constant companions,
where every street corner is an invitation to the absurd,
and where the only required skill is knowing how to laugh at your own decadence.

Me too, like you, I didn't want to.
But you know... you get used to everything.
It's not so bad after a while, you'll see.`,

        title: "Remnants of a Flourishing City",
        content: `The remnants of what was once a flourishing city now lie under a leaden, extinguished sky. The light, an indistinct, dark gray, struggles to pierce the shroud of heavy clouds that accumulate like frantic and inescapable thoughts. The buildings, once imposing, are now reduced to steel and concrete carcasses, like skeletons vainly standing against the inevitability of entropy. The wind, carrying dust and debris, seeps through the ruins, emitting sinister whistles.
The streets, once teeming with life and activity, are now mere paths of desolation, strewn with abandoned cars and rubble. Here and there, a few charred trees raise their gnarled branches to the sky, like silent prayers to absent gods. The acrid smell of decay and rusty metal fills the nostrils, reminding us of the inevitable decline of all material things.

The buildings, gutted by time and abandonment, reveal devastated interiors. Overturned furniture, shards of glass, and everyday objects lie in silent disorder, mute witnesses to the lives once lived here. The gaping windows, with broken panes, seem to contemplate the void, the surrounding devastation.
Despite this scene of desolation, a strange form of beauty persists, a poignant reflection of the fragility of existence. The faded graffiti on the walls, the torn posters floating in the wind, a few intact relics, all compose a visual symphony that tells the story of broken dreams and vanished hopes. It is in this mosaic of ruins that the indelible trace of humanity, its greatness and its flaws, can be read.
Nature, in its eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth, begins to reclaim its rights. Climbing plants cling to cracked facades, tufts of wild grass sprout from the cracks in the asphalt. Here, materiality mingles with the spiritual, suggesting that even in the most total failure, there remains a possibility of renewal, a promise of the future.
This desolate landscape, a reflection of civilizational failure, prompts reflection on the transient, ephemeral nature of our existence and the need to accept both happiness and misfortune. Just as we must learn to master our emotions, we must also accept the inevitable decline of all we build. Perhaps in this acceptance lies the key to a new understanding, a path that leads us beyond mere materiality.`,
