    introduction: "My name is Thibault Lenormand.",
    experience:
      "For over ten years, my path was guided by words, stage, and creation: a degree in modern literature from Avignon University, two years at the theater conservatory and Cours Florent, rich experiences in animation, sales, and catering — all professions of connection, rhythm, and observation.",
    transition:
      'Then the desire to build differently emerged. Create, yes — but this time through digital projects. To bring my ideas to life, to materialize others\'. I therefore started a career transition to web development, following two training blocks at The Hacking Project: the "Full Stack" program, then the "Web Developer" diploma block, totaling six intensive months of coding and two two-month internships.',
    current:
      "Today, I design applications, write clean and readable code, and continue to cultivate curiosity for ideas, uses, words, and humanity.",
    conclusion:
      "This portfolio reflects this intersection: between the rigor of code and the expressiveness of writing. Welcome to my universe.",
